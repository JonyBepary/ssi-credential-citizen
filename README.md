# ssi-credential-citizen
This project showcases a self-sovereign identity flow using ACA-Py agents and a Bifold wallet. An issuer ACA-Py agent issues a VC with username, email, occupation, and citizenship to your mobile wallet. You then generate and share a proof of the VC with a verifier ACA-Py agent, demonstrating credential issuance, storage, and verification.
